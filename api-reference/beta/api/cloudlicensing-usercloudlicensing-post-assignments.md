# Create assignment

Namespace: microsoft.graph.cloudLicensing

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new license assignment by posting to a user's assignments collection.

An assignment must always have a direct relationship to an allotment and to a user or group. If an assignment is created by posting to the a user's assignments collection, located at `/users/{userId}/cloudLicensing/assignments`, the allotment relationship must be established in the request body. Assignments can also be created by posting to the organization's assignments collection, an allotment's assignments collection or a group's assignments collection.
