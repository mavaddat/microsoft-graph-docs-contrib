# driveItem: invite

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Send a sharing invitation for a [driveItem](../resources/driveitem.md). A sharing invitation provides permissions to the recipients and, optionally, sends them an email to notify them that the item was shared.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Permissions canâ€™t be created or modified on the root **driveItem** of [drives](../resources/drive.md) with a **driveType** of `personal` (OneDrive for home).
> * _New_ guests can't be invited using app-only access. Existing guests can be invited using app-only requests.

[!INCLUDE [national-cloud-support](../../includes/all-clouds.md)]

## Permissions

Choose the permission or permissions marked as least privileged for this API. Use a higher privileged permission or permissions [only if your app requires it](/graph/permissions-overview#best-practices-for-using-microsoft-graph-permissions). For details about delegated and application permissions, see [Permission types](/graph/permissions-overview#permission-types). To learn more about these permissions, see the [permissions reference](/graph/permissions-reference).

    { "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveRecipient" },
    { "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveRecipient" }
  ],
  "message": "string"
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
| recipients       | [driveRecipient](../resources/driverecipient.md) collection | A collection of recipients who receive access and the sharing invitation. |
| message          | String                                          | A plain text formatted message that is included in the sharing invitation. Maximum length 2,000 characters. |
| requireSignIn    | Boolean                                         | Specifies where the recipient of the invitation is required to sign-in to view the shared item.            |
| sendInvitation   | Boolean                                         | Specifies if an email or post is generated (`false`) or if the permission is recently created (`true`).            |
| roles            | String collection                              | Specifies the roles that are granted to the recipients of the sharing invitation. |

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a collection of [permission](../resources/permission.md) objects in the response body.

For more information about how errors are returned, see [Error responses](/graph/errors).

### Partial success response

When inviting multiple recipients, it's possible for the notification to succeed for some and fail for others. In this case, the service returns a partial success response with a `207 Multi-Status` status code. When partial success is returned, the response for each failed recipient contains an **error** object with information about what went wrong and how to fix it. For more information, see [Example 2](#example-2-send-sharing-invitation-with-partial-success).

### Send invitation notification errors

The following table shows some other errors that your app might encounter within the nested **innererror** objects when sending notification fails. Apps aren't required to handle these errors.

|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| accountVerificationRequired    | Account verification is required to unblock sending notifications. |

| exchangeMaxRecipients          | Exceeded maximum number of recipients that can be sent notifications at the same time. |
