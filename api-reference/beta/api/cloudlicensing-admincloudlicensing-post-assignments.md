# Create assignment

Namespace: microsoft.graph.cloudLicensing

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Create a new license [assignment](../resources/cloudlicensing-assignment.md) by posting to the assignments collection of an organization.

An assignment must always have a direct relationship to an allotment and to a user or group. If an assignment is created by posting to the central assignments collection located at `/admin/cloudLicensing/assignments`, both of those relationships must be established in the request body. Assignments can also be created by posting to the assignments collection of an allotment, the assignments collection of a user or the assignments collection of a group.
