Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a supported region to establish an Azure network connection for Cloud PCs.

## Methods

|Method|Return type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|[List](../api/virtualendpoint-list-supportedregions.md)|[cloudPcSupportedRegion](../resources/cloudpcsupportedregion.md) collection|List the supported regions that are available for creating Cloud PC connections.|

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
|:---      |:---  |:---         |
|displayName|String|The name for the supported region. Read-only.|
|id|String|The unique identifier for the supported region. Read-only.|
|regionGroup|[cloudPcRegionGroup](#cloudpcregiongroup-values)|The geographic group this region belongs to. Multiple regions can belong to one region group. For example, the `europeUnion` region group contains the Northern Europe and Western Europe regions. A customer can select a region group when provisioning a Cloud PC; however, the Cloud PC is put under one of the regions under the group based on resource capacity. The region with more quota is chosen. Possible values are: `default`, `australia`, `canada`, `usCentral`, `usEast`, `usWest`, `france`, `germany`, `europeUnion`, `unitedKingdom`, `japan`, `asia`, `india`, `southAmerica`, `euap`, `usGovernment`, `usGovernmentDOD`, `unknownFutureValue`, `norway`, `switzerland`，`southKorea`, `middleEast`, `mexico`. Use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following values in this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `norway`, `switzerland`，`southKorea`, `middleEast`, `mexico`. Read-only.|
|geographicLocationType|[cloudPcGeographicLocationType](#cloudpcgeographiclocationtype-values)| The geographic location where the region is located. Possible values are: `default`, `asia`, `australasia`, `canada`, `europe`, `india`, `africa`, `usCentral`, `usEast`, `usWest`, `southAmerica`, `middleEast`, `centralAmerica`, `usGovernment`, `unknownFutureValue`. Default value is default. Read-only.|
|regionRestrictionDetail|[cloudPcSupportedRegionRestrictionDetail](../resources/cloudpcsupportedregionrestrictiondetail.md)| When the region isn't available, all region restrictions are set to `true`. These restrictions apply to three properties: **cPURestricted**, **gPURestricted**, and **nestedVirtualizationRestricted**. **cPURestricted** indicates whether the region is available for CPU, **gPURestricted** indicates whether the region is available for GPU, and **nestedVirtualizationRestricted** indicates whether the region is available for nested virtualization. Read-only.|
|regionStatus|[cloudPcSupportedRegionStatus](#cloudpcsupportedregionstatus-values)|The status of the supported region. Possible values are: `available`, `restricted`, `unavailable`, `unknownFutureValue`. Read-only.|
|supportedSolution|[cloudPcManagementService](../resources/cloudpconpremisesconnection.md#cloudpcmanagementservice-values)|The supported service or solution for the region. The possible values are: `windows365`, `devBox`, `unknownFutureValue`, `rpaBox`. Use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following value or values in this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `rpaBox`. Read-only.|
