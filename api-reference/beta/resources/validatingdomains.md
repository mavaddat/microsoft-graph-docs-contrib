Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The possible values are: <br/><ul><li>`none`: Allows sign in without any domain match; this is the least secure option and is highly discouraged.</li><li>`all`: Requires a domain match for all domains; users are allowed to sign in only if their domain matches.</li><li>`allFederated`: Blocks sign in if the user's domain is federated (for example, when the user comes from a different federated domain), but allows sign in if the user's domain is managed.</li><li>`allManaged`: Blocks sign in if the user's domain is managed, but allows sign in for users from federated domains.</li><li>`enumerated`: Blocks sign in if the user's domain is in the specified enumerated domains list.</li><li>`allManagedAndEnumeratedFederated`: Blocks sign in for all managed domains, and blocks federated domains that are included in the enumerated domains list.</li><li>`unknownFutureValue`: Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use.</li></ul>|
