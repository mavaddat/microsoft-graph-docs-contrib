# cloudPcSnapshot resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Represents a snapshot of the device settings of a Cloud PC that can be used to restore the device system. The background service takes periodically, or a user triggers manually to take the snapshot, for disaster recovery/restore usage. 

For provisioning a new Cloud PC with an imported snapshot, check [Import snapshot](../api/cloudpcsnapshot-importsnapshot.md) API for more information.


Inherits from [entity](../resources/entity.md).

## Properties

|Property|Type|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|cloudPcId|String|The unique identifier for the Cloud PC.|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The date and time at which the snapshot was taken. The timestamp is shown in ISO 8601 format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`.|
|expirationDateTime|DateTimeOffset| The date and time when the snapshot expires. The timestamp is shown in ISO 8601 format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`.|
|healthCheckStatus|[cloudPcSnapshotHealthCheckStatus](#cloudpcsnapshothealthcheckstatus-values)|Indicates the health check status of the Cloud PC snapshot. Possible values are `unknown`, `healthy`, `unhealthy`, `unknownFutureValue`. The default value is `unknown`. Read-only. Nullable.|
|id|String|The unique identifier for the snapshot of the Cloud PC device at a specific point in time. Inherited from [entity](../resources/entity.md).|
|lastRestoredDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The date and time at which the snapshot was last used to restore the Cloud PC device. The timestamp is shown in ISO 8601 format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 is `2014-01-01T00:00:00Z`.|
|snapshotType| [cloudPcSnapshotType](#cloudpcsnapshottype-values)   | The type of snapshot that indicates how to create the snapshot. Possible values are `automatic`, `manual`, `unknownFutureValue`, `retention`. Use the `Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members` request header to get the following value from this [evolvable enum](/graph/best-practices-concept#handling-future-members-in-evolvable-enumerations): `retention`. The default value is `automatic`.|
|status|[cloudPcSnapshotStatus](#cloudpcsnapshotstatus-values)|The status of the Cloud PC snapshot. The possible values are: `ready`, `unknownFutureValue`.|

### cloudPcSnapshotHealthCheckStatus values

|Member|Description|
|:---|:---|
| unknown            | Default. Indicates that both the session host and virtual machine agent connectivity statuses are unknown. |
| healthy            | Indicates that the Cloud PC snapshot is healthy to use. For example, the Cloud PC snapshot is healthy if either the connectivity status of the session host or the virtual machine agent is healthy, or if the virtual machine itself is unreachable due to shutdown or deallocation. |
| unhealthy          | Indicates that the Cloud PC snapshot is unhealthy to use. For example, the Cloud PC snapshot is unhealthy if both the connectivity status of the session host and the virtual machine agent are unhealthy. |
| unknownFutureValue | Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use. |

### cloudPcSnapshotStatus values

|Member|Description|
|:---|:---|
|ready|The snapshot is ready to restore the Cloud PC device.|
|unknownFutureValue|Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use.|

### cloudPcSnapshotType values

|Member|Description|
|:---|:---|
| automatic          | Indicates that Windows 365 regularly creates the snapshot automatically. |
| manual             | Indicates that customer manually takes the snapshot.               |
| unknownFutureValue | Evolvable enumeration sentinel value. Don't use.     |
| retention          | Indicates that the snapshot is a retention snapshot. If a Cloud PC is about to be deprovisioned (manually, due to license expiration, and so on), a snapshot of the Cloud PC is taken as a retention snapshot. It's stored in a Microsoft-managed, limited-function storage account for 90 days. During this period, customers can extract the data or use it to provision a new Cloud PC. After the 90-day retention period, Microsoft disables the account and deletes the customer data. |
